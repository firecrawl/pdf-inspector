High-Performance Connector with Crimp Contacts (Cutaway View)

Crimping results in a gas tight connection between the wire and its terminal. Although there are certainly alternatives to crimping, such as ultrasonic welding, resistance welding, insulation displacement technologies and so on, no other available technology delivers the short cycle times, flexibility and low overall cost of crimping—making it the termination technology of choice for most high-performance connector systems.

Crimp connectors are most commonly used to terminate stranded wire. Crimp-on terminals are attached by inserting the stripped end of the wire into the barrel end of the terminal, which is then mechanically deformed (crimped). Special crimp tools are a must, and are supplied with appropriate accessory attachments to ensure reliable terminations for every wire and contact combination. Military Specification MIL-DTL-22520 provides the aerospace/defense industry with a common set of rugged, reliable hand crimp tools. This specification controls the voltage drop and tensile strength of crimp terminations. Daniels Manufacturing Corporation is the leading manufacturer of these tools.

The AS39029 product series supplied by Glenair includes all the most popular standard and extended duty pin and socket contacts for use in high-performance circular and rectangular multi-pin connectors. We are also well positioned to supply special-purpose contacts to meet unique application requirements.
